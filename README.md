# Side_channel_attack

This rep aims to record my side channel attack learning. Because there are some configuration that might be changed from chipwhisperer, so I save them and use my modified code to do the experience. Even you use official  [chipwhisperer](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer). You may still be stucked by some reasons so I create this rep to help you to solve some problems which I met as well. The special thing I am doing is to implement belief propagation attack on AES and some other operations. Of course, I have done the DPA, CPA, and template attack on AES. 

As a way to learn to measure channel attacks, you can download the official documentation for chipwhipserer

`git clone https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer.git`

You can also refer to my study

`git clone https://github.com/Re1own/Side_channel_attack.git`
